# Downloads & Usage
[Download the latest releases of Combosnel here from the releases page.](https://github.com/Struggleton/Combosnel/releases)

- Combosnel uses ViGEmBus in order to create virtual XInput joysticks. Download the latest release of [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/setup-v1.16.116 "ViGEmBus") and install it.

- Combosnel should create a virtual xinput joystick for use in emulator. Open Training Mode and set the CPU to Control.

# Settings
- Enable Shield (Hold / Flash)
	- Set whether or not the CPU should hold / flash its shield. The numerical dropdown affects how fast the CPU will perform a shield flash.
- Enable SDI (Direction)
	- Set which direction the CPU should SDI in and how fast. 
- Enable DI 
	- Set a direction for the CPU to hold.

# Notes
- Because this application is simply making inputs, we're limited on what we can actually do. No tech/ledge options/savestates/complicated features are in this application's future.
- This application was mainly made for use in the Yuzu emulator. It may or may not work on others.

# Planned features
